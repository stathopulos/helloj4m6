# Rust on the CH32V003J4M6

Firmware running on the CH32V003J4M6 entirely in Rust, complete with `println!` over serial and peripheral access!

These ultra cheap (10-15¢) 32-bit RISC-V micocontrollers are awesome, and thanks to a ton of great work by the people working on the [ch32-rs](https://github.com/ch32-rs) project, alongside some generally great ecosystem support for embedded Rust, they're also awesome to program for.
